# PycURL Development Downloads

This repository contains PycURL binary distributions made from
development snapshots.

Development snapshots are not guaranteed to be stable, or work at all.
Use at your own risk. You should only use these snapshots if the most recent
released version does not work for you for some reason, or you are
testing functionality that has not made it into an official release yet.

NOTE: the version number on the files does not mean files are for that
release! Rather, the files are made from a snapshot that followed the
release in question. For example, files labeled "7.19.0.2" are actually
much closer to 7.19.3 than they are to 7.19.0.2, and since 7.19.0.3
[is nearly equivalent to 7.19.0.2](http://curl.haxx.se/mail/curlpython-2013-12/0029.html),
the "7.19.0.2" development snapshots
contain a ton of functionality that is not in 7.19.0.3 release.

For binaries for official releases, please head over to
[SourceForge download area](http://pycurl.sourceforge.net/download/) or
the corresponding [repository](https://github.com/pycurl/downloads).
